TALDownloader
======

A simple Android app for downloading This American Life episodes by sharing the episode URL from the Browser.
It was a way for me to mess around with parts of the Android API.

Installation
------------

1. Download TAL Downloader from git: `$ git clone git://github.com/blunden/TALDownloader`
2. Build in Eclipse (or add configuration to build with ANT)
3. Sign with your own key (the debug key only works in the emulator) 
4. Install on your device (Unknown sources must be enabled in Settings)

Requirements
-------

Currently requires Android 3.0 APIs. It has however not actually been
functionally tested on anything lower than API level 15 (Android 4.0.3).
